        We are a musical instrument rental company. We currently offer rentals for trumpets, trombones, tubas, flutes, clarinets, and saxophones. Customers can choose to rent new or used instruments. One benefit of renting from our company is that you have the opportunity to gain ownership of an instrument after renting it for 18 months. Thanks for considering us for your instrument rental needs!
